    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m @yonekawa of <a href="http://joybox.io/">Joybox</a> Evangelist(Unofficial).</p>

<p>At 5/29, I talked about Game Development of RubyMotion with Joybox in <a href="http://connpass.com/event/2095/">RubyMotion Kaigi 2013</a>.</p>

<p>This is my slide.<br/>

<h2>RubyMotion Kaigi 2013</h2>

<p>RubyMotion Kaigi 2013 is first RubyMotion conference in Japan!<br/>
Laurent Sansonetti of RubyMotion Developer comes in Japan. He talked about RubyMotion&rsquo;s roadmap.</p>

<p>It is very exciting conference.
The conference has Q&amp;A session to Laurent. @watson1978 talked about RubyMotion in-depth.
In Lightning Talk, some one talked about IRC client development by RubyMotion.</p>

<p>My best session is this by @mfks17.
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mfks17/that-objective-c-guy-think-about-rubymotion">https://speakerdeck.com/mfks17/that-objective-c-guy-think-about-rubymotion</a></p>

<p>Because, I&rsquo;m also Objective-C guy.
RubyMotion teaches Ruby ecosystem for Objective-C guy. I think it is one of the RubyMotion value.
We can return Know-how to Objective-C easily because RubyMotion is thin layer.</p>

<h2>My motivation</h2>

<p>I bought RubyMotion 2 month ago. RubyMotion Kaigi started entries at the same time.<br/>
Want to do some interest thing by RubyMotion for Lightning Talk.
So, I found blog post about RubyMotion + Cocos2D.<br/>
&ldquo;RubyMotion Game Development&rdquo; seems very interesting theme.</p>

<p>However, there was many problem. C++ problem, build failure an app crash&hellip;
I tried many Objective-C wrapper for phyisics engine&hellip;</p>

<p>So I found Joybox at that time. It is amazing project.
I decided to talking about Joybox.</p>

<h2>Joybox</h2>

<p>Joybox is awesome but it is not enough now.
Especially box2d function is not enough because we need to write Objective-C wrapper.</p>

<p>However, RubyMotion community has a high expectation to Joybox.
So, you can do anything for Joybox improvement.
You may be able to become a hero by code of several lines.
Let&rsquo;s pull-request! I will support if you contact on twitter :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dreaming that Rubyist can develop a native game easily with Joybox in a future!</p>

<h2>Extra</h2>

<p>Why does Joybox sample app use Gorilla?
